# Stock-Analysis

We have decided to help Steve in his stock Analysis, in order to to this, we have developed a code that enables Steve to look the Returns and Trading Volume for every year in a Database that has the complete data for 12 stocks for years 2017 and 2018

In our first attempt we developed a code that got through the data as much times it needed until the program had found all the the data for each ticker that ended up doing a loop through the information many times

2018

This was really helpful to get through the information required and give a better informed assessment on the stocks considered

## Improving the code
Although the time to get the results was really fast, we need to consider that this information only included 12 tickers in case the data was bigger the time to get through the data would be considerably longer

we adapted the code so it could run through the data just one time and every time he found values that match the considerations it would be added in variables that eventualy will report the same output but going faster through the information

And it worked!

## Conclusions

In case the model and information we obtained from our analyisis is enough to give an opinion on which stocks to buy, improving the code to get faster and detailed information would be a perfect scenario to spend the time factoring a code, but in case it is not it might be a bigger waste of time to improve a code that a difference in time of less than a second is not really worth the time spent factoring the code
